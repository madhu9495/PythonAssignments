What is the output of the following code:

counter=1
def dolots(count):
 global counter
 for i in (1,2,3):
   counter =count+i;

print dolots(4) #prints None because function does not have any return type
print counter   #Prints 7 because counter is global

-------------------------------------------------------
Output:
None
7
